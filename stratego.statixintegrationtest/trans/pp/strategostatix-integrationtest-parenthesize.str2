module pp/strategostatix-integrationtest-parenthesize

/*
This stub is generated because Spoofax 2 generates the real module in src-gen a little too late
during the build, after Stratego 2 files are already statically checked. This means that without
this stub file, your trans/pp.str2 file may fail to type-check after a clean. This is particularly
problematic if you compile from the command line with Maven, such as during a CI process.
